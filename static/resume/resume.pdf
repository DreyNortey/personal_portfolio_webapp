This file would typically be a binary PDF file. As per the restrictions, I'm not generating the actual PDF content. 

In a real implementation, you would:
1. Create a professional resume in PDF format
2. Save it in this location
3. Make it available for download via the download button in the hero section

For now, this serves as a placeholder to indicate where the resume PDF should be located.
